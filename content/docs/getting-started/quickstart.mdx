description: Get MCP Gateway running and make your first API call in under 5 minutes.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- A terminal with `curl` (or any HTTP client)

## 1. Start MCP Gateway

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kinetic-Solutions-Group/mcpgateway.git
cd mcpgateway
docker compose up -d
```

The gateway API is now running at `http://localhost:8000` and the web UI at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Create an API Key

Open the web UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and navigate to **Settings > API Keys**. Create a new key and copy it — you will need it for every API request.

## 3. Make Your First Request

List the registered MCP servers:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/servers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You should receive an empty list (`[]`), which means the gateway is running and authenticated. You are ready to register your first MCP server.
