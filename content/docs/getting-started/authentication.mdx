description: How to authenticate with the MCP Gateway API using API keys or OAuth.
---

All API requests to MCP Gateway require authentication. Pass a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header with every request.

## API Keys

API keys follow a prefixed format so you can identify their purpose at a glance:

- `mgw_usr_live_*` — production keys
- `mgw_usr_test_*` — test mode keys

Include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/servers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mgw_usr_live_abc123..."
```

## Creating API Keys

1. Open the MCP Gateway web UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**.
3. Click **Create** and give the key a descriptive name.
4. Copy the key immediately — it is only shown once.

## OAuth Apps

MCP Gateway supports OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations that need to act on behalf of users. See the [Authentication architecture docs](/docs/concepts/authentication) for the full OAuth flow, scopes, and token lifecycle.
